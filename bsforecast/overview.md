balance sheet forecasting...
=========================

...mandates a complete double entry build-out

* that integrates with
    1. unvcouhered receipts (`PORCAP`)
    2. open ap (`OPEN`)
    3. open ap checks (`UCHQ`)
    4. open freight checks (not in CMS)
    5. open payroll (not in CMS)
* where the change in net assets matches forecasted net icome
* quickly updated with some top level changes

Basic Premise
---------------
    Everything recorded on the ledger is part of a work flow
    Each flow has a timing to it depending on the parties involved
    Forecast the work flows and the parties involved and you can forecast the gl activity & timeframe
    The existing P&L forecast represents some part of some of the flows and serves as a starting point

Difficulties
* forecasts (other than budget) are not specific enough to link to flows going on in the ledger
* each plant has different behaviors and uses accounts differently
* how do you merge current open ap with forecasted P&L
* all ledger activity has to be claimed by a modeled flow, but not over-allocated
* how do you handle the frequency of which items occur and make sure not to over-forecast infrequent expenditures
* weekly check run schedule
* holding AP at certain times
* collateral
* accrual situations
* change in FX & consolidations
* transfer pricing
* intercomp settlement

Arrising Assumptions
* enhancing of the forecast granularity is central and presumptious
    * inventory levels
    * what costs are fixed
    * capital schedules
    * etc
* base period has to be used to get started
