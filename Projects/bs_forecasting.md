forecasting cash flows, balance sheet, collateral, and loan balances
====================================================================

bucket all activity according to unique ledger patterns. label the pattern.

each economic event will then need to implement the forecasted ledger behavior
* which accounts to use

* timing between events 

        handling in bleed-off schedule?
        forecast each expense account or high-level forecast?

* attachment to drivers

        can setup fixed schedules where drivers don't make sense?

    forecasted drivers
    * fpv
    * eh
    * total spend
    * absorption
    * prior period/year?
    * historic holding period
    * historic schedule

* incur frequency

        generate_series will spool out an incursion basis but the connection to 
        the forecast basis is not clear. need to have a ratio of frequency to forecast basis 
        to pro-rata allocate

* forecast time period basis
