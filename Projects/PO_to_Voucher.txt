Using 'C' option on PO receipt to match invoice -> calculates PPV and stores properly in POMVAR for reporting

PrePaid
------------------

Idea:
3 Items on PO
 - Downpayment to 1210
 - Reverse DOwnPayemtn to 1210
 - Products

Note as collect but customers broker remit-to and carrier remit-to are same so generated receipts can be matched on the same invoice.
